Fun with Async
============================

A hands-on workshop on handing async tasks. 

## Intro 

We'll go through why we need to handle async tasks, some common semantics for doing that like callbacks, Promises and `async`/`await`.

The hands-on aspect is most designed to be run in 2 programming languages, Java and Javascript. This would also enable us to see the differences between the common techniques for handling async tasks in both these ecosystems.


## Task 1 - Dealing with delay/latency


## Task 2 - Doing many things in parallel


## Task 3 - Async dependencies
